Notebook
---------
1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset 
	- Reading the image
	- plotting the image
3. Image Processing
	- converting to blob object
	- defining the class
	- declaring the bounding box
	- convert the array to a numpy array
4. Loading the pre-trained model
	- reading the network layers
	- extract the output layers
5. Image processing
	- appending the image - annotation file and images
	- converting bgr to rgb
	- creating the mask
	- resizing the image
6. Data Augmentation
	- randoming the image
	- rotating the image
	- transforming the image
